# Coding Task

Suppose that you want to communicate to someone who has less context with the data. Set the `labs()` argument to include

-   A title
-   A subtitle
-   Descriptive Labels for the axes
-   A label for what the colors mean.

Each of the labels should be in **plain spoken language** and should be in sentence case:

-   The first letter of the first work should be capitalized
-   The rest of the letters should *not* be capitalized
-   Everything should be a work that you can speak aloud -- i.e. **not** a variable name.

```{r coding task}
squirrel_subset %>%  
  group_by(date_f, primary_fur_color) %>%  
  summarise(count_of_squirrels = n()) %>%  
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = date_f, y = count_of_squirrels, color = primary_fur_color) + 
  stat_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = 'Decreasing Count of Squirrels Through Time',
    subtitle = 'Moving Average Smoother Estimate',
    x = 'Date of Observation',
    y = 'Count of Squirrels',
    color = 'Primary Fur Color'    # change the 'color' in aes
  )
```
